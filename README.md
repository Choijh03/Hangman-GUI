# Hangman-GUI

This is simple Hangman game with GUI that is built by using Netbeans IDE. 

(There is no gurantee that it will run correctly if you use different IDE than Netbeans)

There are only 5 words: abstract, cemetery, nurse, pharmacy, climbing in word bank list (words are randomly selected eahc time of play)

If you like to add more words, go to Play.java file and add more words to word bank list and make sure to change upper_bound(line 70) to correct number.

- User get 6 chances of wrong letter guess, after 6 wrong guess, game ends.

- Score gets deducted 10 points each time when user guess wrong letter.
